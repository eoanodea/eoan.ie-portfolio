Shcoop is a competitive party game where you and your friends can be put up against each other. I lead the project with a team of 3 developers, a designer and a project manager, who are all students.

The application was deployed to Web, Android and iOS. Unfortunately the application never made it to the iOS App Store due to Apple App regualations.
